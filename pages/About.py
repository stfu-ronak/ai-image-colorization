This app is developed as a final college project to demonstrate **AI-based grayscale image colorization**.

### ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- **PyTorch** for deep learning model
- **Streamlit** for web app interface
- **PIL** for image manipulation
- **Matplotlib** for visualizations

### ðŸ§  Model Overview
- 4 convolutional layers
- Uses **dilated convolutions** for better spatial context
- Trained on **CIFAR-10 grayscale to RGB** conversion
- Uses **MSE loss**

### ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
To demonstrate how deep learning can be used for creative tasks like colorization and how enhancement techniques can make results more visually appealing.
